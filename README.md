# Incount

Incount is a project with the purpose of developing a system dedicated to reading production sensors via GPIO, with easy deployment and configuration.

### Using GPIO

**GPIO** is an abbreviation for **General-purpose input/output**.

It is an uncommitted digital signal pin on an integrated circiut or electronic circiut board which may be used as an input or output, or both, and is controllable by software. GPIOs have no predefined purpose and are unused by default.
